# ZMK Support For Beekeeb Piantor Keyboard

This repository contains shield definition for
[Beekeeb Piantor](https://github.com/beekeeb/piantor) keyboard.

> [!NOTE]
> I have only tested this shield definition with WeAct Studio RP2040 board.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyboard with this ZMK configuration, left half is defined as the
> main half. So keyboard will only work when left half is plugged in.

> [!WARNING]
> Donâ€™t connect or disconnect the TRRS cable when the keyboard is powered. Always
> disconnect the USB cable first.

## Building
### GitHub Actions
Prebuilt firmware is available in GitHub actions artifacts. However, default
keymap is very basic, and this a ZMK module, meant to be included in custom
zmk-config repository, or other.

## Flashing
There are two uf2 files, for left and right half of keyboard. Hold `BOOTSEL`
